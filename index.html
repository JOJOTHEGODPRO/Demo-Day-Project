    <div class="Description">
        <p> Ever since I was young, soccer was always my favorite sport. My dad also played soccer so he would train me and we would play together. I think soccer was a significant and influential part of my childhood. This is because I made many friends through soccer and it allowed for further bonding between me and my family. Additonally, playing soccer kept me in great shape and allowed for a maintenance of great mental health. These reasons led me to believe that soccer is the greatest sport to ever be created.</p>
